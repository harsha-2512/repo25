About:
project lays includes detection and classification techniques. It is found that there is an another tissue called cyst mistaken for cancer tumour in most of the cases. So the model lays emphasis on efficient detection by removing all the noise (cyst and other similar white bodies) from mammogram images and producing a sharp and useful image to the system using adaptive mean filters. Further GMM Segmentation is performed on the preprocessed images and Probabilitistic Neural Networks are applied which classifies cancer cells into its phases (normal , benign or malignant).
